* What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

Basically, the workflow between *after commiting* and *before* going on Git Hub to compare and make the pull request.

* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

Collaboration via GitHub - our guide showed us how to make each other collaborators. I can't recreate the workflow, but I am aware that we have that capaability.

* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

"What do I do next?" 
Seriously, I asked that a lot.

I don't remember asking the guide for help. I tried to confine any dscussion to my pair partner.

* What still confuses you about git?

The overall workflow. I have not internalized it yet, but each time I go through it, I remember more without having to look at my cheat sheet. I understand the *why* of git, but am still feeling shaky on the *how*.

* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

It was better than I expected. I was expecting to mess everything up and turn this into a train wreck.
I think it went slowly, but we were able to complete it without the intervention of the guide.
