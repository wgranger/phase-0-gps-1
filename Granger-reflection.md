# What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I was struggling with a few things. First, I didn't necessarily understand what origin was referring to. I understoof how to push and pull things to different branches, but I didn't know why we typed in origin. After this session I have a better understanding of the meaning behind the commands we use in the terminal. Also, I had a merge conflict while working on some of the challenges during the past week. Although I resolved the conflict on my own, I didn't understand how I solved it or what was happening. It was nice to work through a merge conflict with my pair and written instructions so I could see the reasoning behind a merge conflict. 

# What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

Again, the merge conflict was clarified. I now know why there are marks inserted into code that has a merge conflict, and I also know how to resolve this issue. It was also eye-opening to watch how files changed on our directory just from switching to different branches. Before this guided pairing session I felt as though I could push things from my local computer to GitHub, but now I feel much more comfortable. Pushing things to GitHub is now, hopefully, as seamless as checking my email.

# What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

I asked my guide a question about the merge and pull process on GitHub. After initially creating a repo, I assigned my partner as a collaborator on the file. Because of this, I was able to assign him to review a pull request and execute the merge. It was pretty cool to see us working as a team through the process. Although I created the repo and sent the request, he received a notification to follow through with the merge. This made it more apparant how GitHub can be used to help teams of people work together. 

# What still confuses you about git?

I'm still a bit unclear about a couple steps from pulling off the remote repo. According to the canvas instructions, it looks like the remote repository is pulled from the origin and put onto the local master and those changes are pushed onto the feature branch. It seems like the method should be the other way around, and I'm sure that is inevidably what happens, put the syntax just seems a little odd to me. Besides that, I feel pretty confortable committing changes.
